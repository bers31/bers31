### üåü Projects
I thrive on building projects that combine data analysis and frontend development to solve real-world problems, enhance user experience, and provide practical insights. Here are some of the highlights from my portfolio:

- **YC Electric - Custom E-Commerce Website on Blogger Platform**  
  Developed a custom e-commerce platform serving over 500 users, complete with login, product search, and shopping cart functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Leveraged MySQL to manage data for over 100 products and handle 50+ daily transactions in real-time. Enhanced user experience with interactive UI/UX elements and SEO optimization, resulting in a significant boost in organic traffic and user engagement.

- **Student Academic Information System (SI-MAS) for University Courses**  
  Created a robust, web-based academic information system to streamline course enrollment for 1,000+ students. Built using Laravel and MySQL, the system automates data validation and CRUD operations, reducing average enrollment time by 30% and enhancing administrative efficiency for faculty and students alike.

- **3D Minecraft Development Using C++ and OpenGL**  
  Designed a 3D game inspired by Minecraft, where players control a bear character to interact with the environment. Implemented efficient matrix manipulations and vector handling in OpenGL to create realistic gameplay with interactive objects, such as trees, rocks, and stackable blocks. This project showcases my foundational skills in game development, graphics rendering, and performance optimization.

- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Prediction and Analysis for the Next 10 Years**  
  Conducted an in-depth data analysis and built a predictive model using Python, Excel, and R to forecast greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade. This project aims to support Net Zero Emission goals by providing accurate forecasts that inform emissions reduction policies and promote sustainable practices.

- **COVID-19 Cases Prediction and Analysis for 1-Year Forecast**  
  Utilized ARIMA and regression models in Python and R to develop a predictive model that forecasts COVID-19 cases for the following year. Through careful data preprocessing and model tuning, this project provides actionable insights for health organizations to plan mitigation strategies, identifying trends in virus transmission and factors influencing case surges.
  
- **Custom Search Engine Using Vector Space Model (VSM) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)**
  Developed a specialized search engine that ranks documents based on relevance by implementing Vector Space Model (VSM) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) techniques in Python. This project improves search accuracy by 35% through semantic understanding and contextual matching between search terms and document content.

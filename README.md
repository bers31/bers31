### 🌟 Projects
I enjoy working on projects that combine data analysis and web development to solve real-world problems and improve user experience. Check out my GitHub portfolio to explore my latest work!

- **YC Electric - Custom E-Commerce Website on Blogger Platform**  
  Developed a custom e-commerce website with features such as user login, product search, and shopping cart functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for over 500 users. Managed 100+ products and 50+ daily transactions using MySQL for real-time data processing. Enhanced user experience with interactive UI/UX elements and SEO optimization, which significantly increased organic traffic.

- **Student Academic Information System (SI-MAS) for University Courses**  
  Created a web-based information system for managing academic course enrollment for 1,000+ students each semester. This system uses Laravel and MySQL for data CRUD operations and academic validation. Achieved a 30% reduction in average enrollment time, improving data accuracy and streamlining the administrative process for both students and faculty.

- **Simple 3D Minecraft Development Using C++ and OpenGL**  
  Built a 3D game inspired by Minecraft, featuring a bear character that can walk, jump, and interact with the 3D environment. The game includes interactive objects like trees, comets, sun, stackable blocks, and rocks, providing a stable gameplay experience and realistic interactions through optimized matrix manipulation and efficient vector handling.

- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Prediction and Analysis for the Next 10 Years**  
  Conducted data analysis and developed a predictive model to project greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade using Python, Excel, and R. This project supports emission reduction policy-making by providing accurate emissions forecasts, contributing to Net Zero Emission goals.

- **COVID-19 Case Prediction and Analysis for 1-Year Forecast**  
  Built a predictive model using machine learning algorithms (ARIMA and regression models) in Python and R to analyze and predict COVID-19 cases for the following year. The project helps health organizations plan effective mitigation strategies by identifying trends in virus spread and factors influencing case fluctuations.
